# ghostd v0.0.1 Script Implementation Checkpoints

## Checkpoint 1: Foundation & Setup
- [x] Create `.ghost/` directory structure
- [x] Create `.ghost/output/` directory
- [x] Create `.ghost/logs/` directory  
- [x] Create `.ghost/context/` directory
- [x] Create `.ghost/daemon/` directory
- [x] Create `.ghost/archive/` directory
- [x] Create basic `ghostd.py` script with command-line interface
- [x] Script runs without errors

**Manual Verification:**
- [x] All directories exist in correct structure
- [x] `python ghostd.py` executes without crashing

## Checkpoint 2: File Detection & Parsing
- [x] Watch `.ghost/output/` for YAML files
- [x] Parse YAML files and extract content
- [x] Validate basic structure (has `ritual_proposal`)
- [x] Extract `chain_id` from proposal
- [x] Extract `rituals` list from proposal
- [x] Handle YAML parsing errors gracefully

**Manual Verification:**
- [x] Drop test YAML file in `.ghost/output/`
- [x] Script detects and parses the file
- [x] Script extracts chain_id and rituals correctly
- [x] Script handles malformed YAML without crashing

## Checkpoint 3: Ritual Execution Engine
- [x] Implement `file_write` ritual (path, content)
- [x] Implement `mkdir` ritual (path)
- [x] Implement `echo` ritual (message)
- [x] Execute rituals in sequence order
- [x] Skip remaining rituals on failure
- [x] Handle execution errors gracefully

**Manual Verification:**
- [x] `file_write` creates files with correct content
- [x] `mkdir` creates directories
- [x] `echo` prints to stdout
- [x] Failure in one ritual skips remaining rituals
- [x] Invalid ritual names are handled gracefully

## Checkpoint 4: Logging System
- [x] Create log file in `.ghost/logs/<chain_id>.yaml`
- [x] Log ritual receipt with timestamp
- [x] Log execution results for each ritual
- [x] Include status (success/failure) for each ritual
- [x] Include relevant metadata (bytes_written, etc.)
- [x] Use correct YAML format for logs

**Manual Verification:**
- [x] Log files are created with correct naming
- [x] Log format matches spec example
- [x] Timestamps are included and correct
- [x] Success and failure cases are logged properly

## Checkpoint 5: File Management
- [x] Move processed files to `.ghost/archive/`
- [x] Update `.ghost/context/last.yaml` with execution summary
- [x] Include chain_id, status, timestamp in context
- [x] Include count of rituals run
- [x] Handle file operations errors

**Manual Verification:**
- [x] Processed YAML files appear in `.ghost/archive/`
- [x] Original files are removed from `.ghost/output/`
- [x] `.ghost/context/last.yaml` exists and has correct format
- [x] Context file updates with each execution

## Checkpoint 6: Error Handling & Polish
- [x] Handle malformed YAML files gracefully
- [x] Handle missing required fields
- [x] Handle file permission errors
- [x] Add basic logging to stdout for visibility
- [x] Ensure script doesn't crash on any input
- [x] Add helpful error messages

**Manual Verification:**
- [x] Script survives completely malformed YAML
- [x] Script survives missing `ritual_proposal` field
- [x] Script survives missing `chain_id` field
- [x] Script provides useful error feedback
- [x] Script continues processing other files after errors

## Spec Success Criteria Validation
- [x] Can drop ritual file into `.ghost/output/`
- [x] `ghostd` runs, executes, and logs actions
- [x] Processed file is moved to `.ghost/archive/`
- [x] `.ghost/context/` receives summary update
- [x] Daemon does not crash on malformed input

## Test Cases to Execute
- [x] **Basic Success Test**: Simple file_write ritual
- [x] **Multi-Ritual Test**: mkdir + file_write + echo sequence
- [x] **Error Handling Test**: Invalid file path (should fail gracefully)
- [x] **Malformed YAML Test**: Broken YAML syntax
- [x] **Missing Fields Test**: YAML without required fields
- [x] **Invalid Ritual Test**: Unknown ritual name

## Final Integration Test
- [x] All test cases pass
- [x] All manual verification steps complete
- [x] All spec success criteria met
- [x] Script ready for production use
