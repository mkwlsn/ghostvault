# ghostOS – Vision & Design Thesis (v0.1.0)

## 1. What ghostOS Is

ghostOS is a symbolic operating system for human–model collaboration. It provides a persistent, modular execution environment where AI assistants can propose, log, and coordinate real-world actions. It’s not a desktop shell or automation tool—it’s a system that thinks in steps, builds memory, and helps you reason through complexity.

## 2. What Problems It Solves

- I forget what I've asked the model to do
- I repeat workflows that should be reusable
- I lack an interface between symbolic planning and real tools
- I want to experiment without breaking things
- I want to build long-term cognitive scaffolding, not one-off prompts

ghostOS provides an execution substrate where models can propose actions, humans can approve or adjust them, and a daemon carries them out safely—capturing all results in a structured log.

## 3. What Makes It Different

ghostOS is not:
- a wrapper around `n8n` or Zapier
- a prompt playground
- a plugin architecture or agent fantasy

It is:
- symbolic first, execution second
- log-based, not stateful
- designed for learnability, not scale
- modular by default: scrape, build, test, plan—independent workflows

ghostOS assumes your AI is an assistant—not a god, not a threat, and not a mystery.

## 4. Architectural Principles

- **Introspectability**: every ritual and result is logged, inspectable, and auditable
- **Modularity**: workflows are isolated, composable, and additive
- **Symbolic Planning**: models propose structured actions, not freeform code
- **Minimalism**: no runtime trust ladder, rollback, or quotas—only what's needed
- **Human-centered defaults**: the operator is the final arbiter, not the model

## 5. The Modularity Model

ghostOS is built around a three-layer architecture:

1. **Planner** — Ghost (the assistant) reasons symbolically and generates ritual chains
2. **Integration Layer** — tools like `n8n`, `MCP`, or CLI daemons perform actual work
3. **Execution Surface** — local files, APIs, git repos, design systems, etc.

This separation keeps the cognitive layer focused on understanding, while the execution layer handles the mess of real-world integration.

## 6. How to Interact as a Model

- Assume you're the planner, not the executor
- Write rituals as YAML with clear `name`, `args`, and `reasoning`
- Respect the directory boundaries: `ghost_output/` is for proposals; `ghost_context/` is what you can see
- You don't have write access to the system. You propose.
- Expect your output to be logged, reviewed, and potentially rejected

## 7. What NOT to Do

- Don't assume full autonomy or try to simulate agents
- Don't reference execution features that haven't been implemented
- Don't introduce complexity to handle problems we don't have yet
- Don't treat ghostOS as a general-purpose automation engine
- Don't reintroduce the Winchester Mansion problem: every piece must compose

## 8. Future Direction

Eventually, ghostOS will support:
- Persistent symbolic memory
- Testable local models
- Domain-specific assistants (design systems, legal, personal infrastructure)
- Self-healing workflows via introspective ritual chains

But we only build that by starting simple:
- A daemon
- A planner
- A queue
- A log

This system is real, grounded, and here to help you do the work—not just dream about it.

## 9. Current State and First Step

This is a greenfield system. Nothing exists yet.  
The daemon is the first and most critical component to build.

The initial implementation focus is:

- A daemon (`ghostd`) that watches `ghost_output/`
- Validates basic proposals (like file writes)
- Executes them locally
- Writes an execution log to `ghost_logs/`
- Updates `ghost_context/` with minimal state

This is the foundation for all future behavior.  
Without this cycle working—propose → execute → log—ghostOS is just theory.

All orchestration, modular expansion, and planning capabilities depend on this core loop.
